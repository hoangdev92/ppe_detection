# Detection thresholds - tuned for person tracking
track_high_thresh: 0.4      # Higher = more confident tracks (reduce false positives)
track_low_thresh: 0.15      # Allow second-stage recovery of lower-confidence detections
new_track_thresh: 0.5       # Higher = fewer spurious new tracks

# Track management
track_buffer: 50            # Keep tracks longer (good for occlusions/people moving)
match_thresh: 0.7           # Lower = more lenient matching (better for moving people)
fuse_score: true            # Combine detection confidence with tracking

# Motion compensation (for static camera, use 'none'; for moving camera use 'sparseOptFlow')
gmc_method: none            # Static camera - no global motion compensation needed

# ReID - appearance-based re-identification
with_reid: false            # Disable ReID to avoid dependency issues; use IoU + motion instead
proximity_thresh: 0.5       # Min IoU for proximity matching
appearance_thresh: 0.25     # ReID similarity threshold (not used when with_reid=false)

# Track lifecycle
max_age: 50                 # Frames before deleting lost track (higher = more stable IDs)
min_hits: 3                 # Minimum detections before confirming track (reduce false starts)
